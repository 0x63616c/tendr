# Tendr

A native, local-first iPhone journal for GLP-1 treatment. Built with SwiftUI and Swift Charts, with no sign-in, tracking SDKs or runtime dependencies.

Available as a private TestFlight beta.

Track doses in mg, mL or explicitly confirmed U-100 syringe units; keep vial records; log weight and notes; import body weight read-only from Apple Health; review progress and estimated medication decay, including what your schedule implies; and schedule weekly, every-few-days or hand-picked dose dates, with reminders. A schedule can be cleared at any time. You can edit past records and optionally keep Tendr's weight history anchored to your first dose.

Medication curves are simplified half-life estimates, not measured body or blood levels or dosing advice. Historical records retain their medication and concentration. Follow the instructions from your prescriber.

## Run

Requires macOS, Xcode 26.2 or later and [XcodeGen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen).

```sh
xcodegen generate
open Still.xcodeproj
```

Choose the Still scheme and an iPhone simulator. The internal target and bundle identifier still use the earlier project name. For a device build, select your own development team.

Launch with `--demo` for synthetic, in-memory sample data. Demo mode never writes to your health journal or schedules reminders. `--uitest` selects a separate test journal when used without demo mode.

## Tests

```sh
swift test
xcodebuild -project Still.xcodeproj -scheme Still \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=Tend QA Pro Max' test \
  CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO
```

The Swift package tests cover calculations, validation, local calendar scheduling and file compatibility. UI tests exercise real simulator screens. See [architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md), [user journeys](docs/USER-JOURNEYS.md) and [verification notes](docs/TESTING.md). Passing tests do not imply clinical validation or TestFlight publication.

## CI on a self-hosted Mac

Every macOS job runs on GitHub-hosted `macos-15` unless the repository variable `MACOS_RUNNER` says otherwise. To use a Mac of your own (for example a Mac mini), sign in to the GitHub CLI on that Mac and run:

```sh
scripts/setup-mac-runner.sh --use 0x63616c/tendr 0x63616c/shots 0x63616c/festr
```

Repositories on a personal account can't share a runner, so the script registers one runner per repository. Each lives in `~/actions-runners/OWNER-REPO`, runs as its own launchd service and has the labels `self-hosted, macOS, ARM64, xcode`. The script also:

- checks for Xcode, accepts the licence and runs `xcodebuild -runFirstLaunch`
- checks for an iOS simulator runtime; pass `--install-ios-runtime` to download one
- prepares `/Users/runner/hostedtoolcache`, which `ruby/setup-ruby` needs on self-hosted Macs
- with `--use`, sets `MACOS_RUNNER` to `["self-hosted","macOS","ARM64","xcode"]` and `DEVELOPER_DIR` to the Mac's Xcode

To go back to GitHub-hosted runners, delete the `MACOS_RUNNER` and `DEVELOPER_DIR` variables. Workflows select the runner with:

```yaml
runs-on: ${{ startsWith(vars.MACOS_RUNNER, '[') && fromJSON(vars.MACOS_RUNNER) || vars.MACOS_RUNNER || 'macos-15' }}
env:
  DEVELOPER_DIR: ${{ vars.DEVELOPER_DIR || '/Applications/Xcode_26.2.app/Contents/Developer' }}
```

`MACOS_RUNNER` can be one label or a JSON list of labels. Copy the same two lines into shots and festr. The services run while the Mac's user is logged in, so turn on automatic login and keep the Mac awake. Every job has a `timeout-minutes` limit, so a hung build stops on its own.

## Privacy and storage

The health journal is stored in the app's Application Support directory using atomic file writes. Apple Health access is read-only. No backend or telemetry is included. Device backups follow iOS settings.

## Contributing

Keep changes focused on a user journey. Add a failing regression test before changing calculation or persistence behaviour, and include actual simulator screenshots for UI changes. Never commit personal health data, signing credentials or provisioning profiles. Use synthetic fixtures in screenshots.
